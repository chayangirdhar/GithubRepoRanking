## Workflow

1. The project locates all of the repositories linked to the requested user and finding all files in the respective repositories that were created using C/C++, Python, or Java.The code that is found in those files is then retrieved, and it is added in a dictionary.
2. After that, pre-process the codes into small chunks and sends those chunks of code to OpenAI using Langchain's llm model querying for technical complexity evaluation.

3. After determining the average Technical Complexity of a specific repository, it predicts the most complex repository of a specific user.
## Instructions

1. After getting tokens from [Here](https://github.com/chayangirdhar/GithubRepoScorer/blob/main/README.md#api-reference) 

2. Add those token values to Sceret.py file as strings 

3. Run main.py file
